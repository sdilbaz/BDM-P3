### Problem 1 SparkSQL for Processing Purchase Transactions (Hamidullah Sakhi)
#### Data Generation
Simple python code for generating the two datasets
#### SparkSQL
We used Pyspark in Jupyter notebook for the queries. 

### Problem 2 Spark-RDDs: Scala For Computing Relative-Density Scores at Scale (Serdarcan Dilbaz)
The logic for the Python and Scala implementation are identical. The pseudocode for problems 2.B, 2.C, 2.D will be outlined and the difference in execution times will be listed.

#### Problem 2.A: Create the Datasets
The data generation process is carried out in Python with a generator and uniform distribution for the points is assumed. To get a dataset of about 100MB, 8,000,000 coordinates were generated in the (x,y) format.

#### Problem 2.B: Report the TOP 10 grid cells with highest Relative-Density Scores
The SparkContext is used to read the data from file. A mapper function is used to convert the lines in the data into tuples. Regions are identified by two coordinates instead of a single integer as to simplify the neighborhood computations. For instance, cell 1 corresponds to (0,0), cell 2 to (1,0) and so on... The region ids in the form of coordinates are calculated with a map function. The counts for each region are calculated with a reduceByKey where the key is the region id. For each region, 9 replicas with the neighbors are generated by a flatMap function on the counts. The combineByKey function is used to convert the data to form suitable for relative density computation. The first entry in the tuples correspond to the region ids. The second entry corresponds to the counts  within the neighborhood of the region id. A sample record at this point: ((154,349),ListBuffer(50.0, 38.0, 21.0, 23.0, 30.0, 25.0, 32.0, 32.0, 30.0)) The relative density is calculated by calculating the mean of the neighborhood regions from the previous step. The relative density is sorted to retrieve the top k grid cells.

#### Problem 2.C: Report the TOP k grid cells w.r.t their Relative-Density Scores


#### Problem 2.D: Report groups of similarly populated cells and their connectedness

#### Python and Scala Time Comparison (in seconds)
| Problem | Scala | Python |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 2.B | 20 | 78 |
| 2.C | 37 | 185 |
| 2.D |  15 | 84 |
